        Rails began with my own struggle to untangle my on-chain activity. That confusion — and a desire to contribute
        meaningfully to the blockchain space — led me to build <a href="https://rails.finance" target="_blank">Rails</a>, a web app designed to make DeFi protocols clear and
        accessible for everyone.

      <h2 id="discovering-digital-truth-20182021">Discovering Digital Truth (2018–2021)</h2>

      <p>
        In 2018, Ethereum’s promise of programmable property rights — <em>digital truth</em> — captured my
        imagination. At a time when it felt like we were surrendering our digital <em>selves</em> to a handful of big
        tech companies, the idea that blockchains would enable an individual's control over their data excited me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet up to 2021, I mostly watched from the sidelines — fascinated by the innovation and the drama, but wary
        of the scams, hacks and the complexity that made using the technology feel risky.
      </p>

      <h2 id="the-kitchen-table-blueprint-2021">The Kitchen Table Blueprint (2021)</h2>

      <p>
        By mid-2021, curiosity won out. I opened a position on{" "}
        <a href="https://liquity.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Liquity
        </a>{" "}
        — a DeFi lending protocol that
        issues a stablecoin (LUSD) as a debt asset and relies on sophisticated on-chain mechanics to hold its peg to the
        dollar.
      </p>

      <p>
        As someone who’s not naturally comfortable with numbers and dyslexic, understanding how it all worked was a challenge. Given that the blockchain is a public ledger, it seemed like it <em>should</em> be straightforward. I found myself sketching lines between the protocol and my wallet across a timeline — a
        map began to take shape. That map helped me decode my transactions and <em>see</em> clearly what was happening.
        It became the blueprint for{" "}

          Rails

      <p>
        I moved from sketches to HTML and CSS — at first, just for fun. Being a self-employed graphic designer with a background in medical illustration, I'd spent years
        synthesizing complex information into simple visualisations. The more I explored, the clearer it became that DeFi
        was missing a visual, plain-language layer to bridge the gap between users and protocols — one built on{" "}
        <em>progressive disclosure</em>, where clarity comes from revealing detail step by step — giving users a simple overview of their activity before guiding them into the deeper mechanics of an application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fueled by that vision, I began mocking up prototypes for more sophisticated portfolio explorers — tools that
        could traverse multiple blockchains, decentralised applications, and off-chain finance.
      </p>

      <p>
        I shared those early mockups with a former boss — now the chairman of <strong>Elliptic</strong>, a blockchain
        forensics firm. His enthusiasm gave me the confidence to make Rails my mission. He introduced me to Elliptic’s
        CEO, who recommended I plug into the vibrant crypto community.
      </p>

      <p>
        I applied to attend the <a href="https://ethglobal.com">ETHGlobal</a> hackathon, ETHAmsterdam 2022 — that weekend strengthened my
        belief that I was on to something. I joined a team designing a cutting-edge{" "}
        <a href="https://ethglobal.com/showcase/soul-protocol-69p0s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

        project. I met Liquity’s
        inventor, shared my work with others (including{" "}
        <a href="https://x.com/JustinCBram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Justin Bram
        </a>
        , the YouTube educator whose{" "}
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z9dxvkqF7E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

        </a>
        ), and
        received genuine enthusiasm for what I was building. I was excited for what could come next.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fired up by that energy, I headed to{" "}
        <a href="https://ethglobal.com/showcase/rails-s6n2z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

        . I set out to find a developer to
        team up with. My hack was a visualiser for a Superfluid app, set on a Rails-like platform; it wasn't the grand
        project idea but opened my mind to a more niche approach and won me a pool prize — I also landed some design work
        on a Superfluid project visualising{" "}
        <a href="https://geoweb.land/governance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          streaming quadratic funding

        , gaining valuable experience and
        connections but falling short of finding a collaborator.

      <h2 id="getting-real--20222023">Getting Real (2022–2023)</h2>

      <p>
        I enlisted a developer friend and he played with building a prototype that could capture <em>every</em>{' '}
        transaction on Ethereum mainnet  — building an explorer that turned wallet transactions into simple, map-like
        visualisations. It was beautiful but proved a point that a lot happens on-chain and taking this approach was
        going to have huge overheads.
      </p>

      <p>
        By this point, Rails was consuming most of my time. I was turning down paid work to focus on it, but with a
        family and bills to pay, the pressure for it to materialise into something sustainable was mounting.
      </p>

      <p>
        In late 2023, I formalised my vision in a grant proposal to the Ethereum Foundation — describing Rails as <em>“route
        maps for Ethereum”</em>, a public good to help users understand the network. Though the application was unsuccessful,
        the process clarified the mission: start small, build for one protocol, and prove the value of making DeFi
        visible.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started where it all began: <strong>Liquity</strong>. With no choice but to work solo, I built and rebuilt
        Liquity V1 explorers, learning the protocol’s transaction patterns inside out.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Rails to become a true visual language, it had to adapt beyond Liquity.. I took this streamlined
        approach to{" "}
        <a href="https://ethglobal.com/showcase/rails-20fvz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

        (for CowSwap) and later to{" "}

          ETHLondon 2024

        (for Morpho), applying a protocol-first Rails design language.
      </p>

      <p>
        Protocols responded positively, but I knew I needed something more concrete — a working prototype of protocol
        events. That was when I began, in earnest, to become a better developer. If Rails was going to work, it was the
        only way forward. Stepping into development from design proved to be an essential step in my own development.
      </p>

      <h2 id="finding-market-fit-20242025">Finding Market Fit (2024–2025)</h2>

      <p>
        In early 2024, I began chatting with the <strong>Liquity</strong> team, sharing updates on Rails and exchanging
        ideas about how it might help their users. By the time we met in person at <strong>ETHCC 2024</strong>, they
        were already familiar with my work. When I introduced myself to <strong>Michael</strong>, Liquity’s CEO, he was
        enthusiastic about the project and encouraged me to keep developing it — suggesting that if I could turn it into
        something genuinely useful, I should apply for a grant.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the conference, we kept in touch online, and I threw myself into building
        a more sophisticated explorer — one that could demonstrate the value of making protocol activity truly legible.
        Still working solo and without a developer, I felt I had to prove I could build a robust, production-ready app on
        my own.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks to rapid progress in AI tools, that goal became more achievable. I began producing work I felt confident
        enough to share publicly and, with Liquity’s encouragement, formally applied for a grant to help push the build
        over the line.
      </p>

      <p>
        At <strong>ETHCC 2025</strong>, I showed Michael the latest version — a working Liquity explorer that reflected
        everything I’d been building toward. The feedback was hugely positive, and for the first time, it felt like Rails
        had moved from an idea to a real, living product. It was a milestone moment after years of iteration.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same event, through <strong>Victor</strong> from Lens, I met <strong>Slava (@slvdev)</strong> — a
        developer who immediately understood the vision behind Rails. With Liquity’s grant contribution on the horizon, we began collaborating, turning years of solo work into a partnership while continuing to self-fund the
        remaining development.
      </p>

      <h2 id="team-rails-2025">Team Rails (2025)</h2>

      <p>
        By the time Slava joined, Rails had gone from sketches to a working application — but it needed an engineer’s
        discipline to reach production quality. His technical depth and rigour have brought the stability and precision
        Rails needs to become real infrastructure. For the first time, we can focus on shaping the experience and
        expanding to new protocols — knowing the foundation beneath it is solid.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, we’ve built a base that truly lives up to the original vision: a platform ready to grow with DeFi —
        and, permit me to be <a href="http://github.com/liquity/bold" target="_blank" title="Liquity V2 BOLD Github Repo">BOLD</a>, to help <em>grow</em> DeFi itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rails is the beginning of an ecosystem — a place where complex financial protocols can finally be made clear,
        human, and usable. The mission hasn’t changed since those first kitchen table sketches — to make DeFi legible for
        everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        We launched the new{" "}
        <a href="https://rails.finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

        Rails V2 is live with full Liquity coverage, built on infrastructure meant for the long haul. We’re self-funding

        growing.
